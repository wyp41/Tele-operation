# Choosing the Right Unity Version for Windows Mixed Reality Development

This README provides guidance on selecting the appropriate Unity version for developing Windows Mixed Reality applications. It is based on best practices and recommendations outlined by Microsoft.

## **Recommended Unity Versions**

### **Long-Term Support (LTS)**
- **Why Use LTS?**
  - Unity LTS versions are recommended for production-ready projects. They offer stability and long-term support with bug fixes and patches, without introducing new features.
  - These versions are ideal for ensuring compatibility and minimizing risks.

- **Current Recommendation**
  - Use the latest Unity LTS version compatible with your project and tools (e.g., Unity 2021 LTS or Unity 2022 LTS).

### **Tech Stream**
- **Why Use Tech Stream?**
  - Tech Stream versions are designed for developers who want access to the latest Unity features.
  - Suitable for experimental projects or when adopting new features is a priority.

- **Caution**
  - Tech Stream versions are not recommended for production projects, as they may introduce instability.

## **Unity XR Plugin Framework**

Windows Mixed Reality development leverages Unity's XR Plugin Framework. Ensure the following:
1. Install the **Windows Mixed Reality XR Plugin** through Unity's Package Manager.
2. Use Unity versions that fully support XR Plugin Management (Unity 2019.3 and later).

## **Compatibility with MRTK (Mixed Reality Toolkit)**

- **MRTK Version**
  - Use the latest MRTK version compatible with your chosen Unity LTS version.
  - Refer to the MRTK release notes for specific Unity version support.

- **Unity Features**
  - MRTK works best with Unity XR Plugin Management enabled.
  - Ensure that your Unity version supports the XR features required by MRTK.
